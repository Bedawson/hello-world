# hello-world

Heya!

Dawson speaking here, I enjoy the good'ol HTML and css and currently working on my first website!
I really enjoy creating and designing, as I am working to shift careers from General contracting (Construction, like building homes, you know like with hammers and nails) into the e commerce world! Over.
